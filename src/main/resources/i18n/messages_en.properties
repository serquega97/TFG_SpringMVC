label.shipdesc = Next, we detail the most important points regarding shipments. For any questions you can always contact us by mail or by calling us:
label.shipdesc1 = During the processing of your order, you can choose the shipping option from those that are available. Available shipping options vary for each order, depending on various factors such as product type, availability, weight, size, and delivery address. If you cannot choose a shipping option for a specific order, it means the option is not available for that order.
label.shipdesc2 = The total shipping cost is calculated by adding the costs of each "shipment" and the costs per "kilogram". Costs per kilogram apply to actual weight (marked as shipping weight) and dimensional weight (package dimensions - space the product will occupy in the delivery truck).
label.shipdesc3 = Delivery today is available for deliveries of eligible products in most postal codes of the Community of Madrid and for some postal codes within the city of Barcelona. The option will be offered when processing the order only if it is available for your postal code.
label.shipdesc4 = If you choose the Standard Shipping option, we will deliver your order in 3 business days in most cases. Depending on the availability and location of the product, the delivery time could be longer. This delivery period begins to be effective at the time the product is shipped.
label.shipdesc5 = If you choose the Premium Shipping option, we will deliver your order the next day, Saturdays and Sundays included. You can select this option as long as it is available for your product and postal code and you have not exceeded the deadline for next day delivery. This delivery period begins to be effective at the time the product is shipped.
label.shipdesc6 = We will charge you a deposit amount to cover the costs of importing the products. With your permission, the transport company or the corresponding agent will use this deposit to pay on your behalf, or on behalf of the recipient, the import costs to the authorities of the country of destination of your order. The amount of these expenses is determined by the laws of that country and the payment of the same is borne by the importer.
label.shipdesc7 = The estimated availability of each product informs you of when we calculate that it will be available in one of our distribution centers and allows you to estimate the time it will take to receive your order.
label.shipdesc8 = With your delivery preferences you can give us additional information about the selected address or indicate how you want us to deliver your order if no one is available at the time of delivery.
